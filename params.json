{"name":"Kivy Collective","tagline":"Assimilation of user widgets is our directive. Resistance is futile.","body":"### Welcome to Kivy Collective\r\n\r\n.. Note: This Page is UNDER CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThis is an organization for developers/users of Kivy widgets, add-ons and related software.\r\n[Join us][1]\r\n\r\nGeneral Guidelines\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n1. Keep the Widget and add-on simple. **Do one task and do it well**.\r\n2. Your repository will be named \"collective.widgetname\". This will allow us to\r\n import your widget by using the following import statement::\r\n    \r\n    from kivy.collective.widgetname import WidgetName\r\n\r\n3. Name your widget correctly. Don't put \"Widget\" in the widget name as this is obvious. \r\n(SliderWidget, ProgressBarWidget are wrong, keep it simple.)\r\n4. Create adequate documentation that explains the functionality of your widget.\r\n5. Follow the [PEP8 guidelines][2] for coding standards.\r\n6. Follow the kivy [guidelines for contributing][3]. To install the pep8 checker into your git directory do\r\n\r\n    cp path-to-kivy/kivy/tools/pep8checker/pre-commit.githook path-to-your-source/.git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n    chmod +x path-to-collective-source/.git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n\r\n    Then assuming you have kivy in your path, our style guide check will run whenever you do a commit, and if there are violations in the parts that you changed, your commit will be aborted. Fix & retry.\r\n7. Use the [Monitor module][4] to ensure that your widget can maintain a FPS rate above 60, ensuring smooth interaction with the user.\r\n8. Follow the [performance guidelines for Python][5], like:: ensuring minimim `.` lookups, avoiding .lookups in loops...\r\n9. As a way of self-organizing widgets, add your widget to the showcase[linkTODO] that best fits the subject area. If no showcase yet exists for a topic, [open a ticket][7] to make a request. We'd like to keep the number of showcases to a minimum, but know that it will take additional categories as the number of widgets grows.\r\n10. Use tags instead of a directory structure to categorize your widgets in the documentation.\r\n\r\nNote: you must have a GitHub account to open a ticket. You can create one for free [here][8].\r\nNew repository.\r\n\r\nOther issues\r\n------------\r\nFor all other issues, please open a ticket.\r\n\r\nDisabling notification spam\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nBy default you are subscribed to all new collective github repository notifications. Unless you disable this yourself, your inbox will soon contain only Github spam.\r\n\r\n    Go to https://github.com/watching\r\n    Select what to watch or Uncheck Automatically watch. But attention: latter will disable watch for all organizations.\r\n\r\nTransferring repository ownership to the Kivy Collective\r\n\r\nHow to move your repository to Kivy Collective shared ownership. About transfering the ownership of repositories. See Github instructions regarding transfers\r\n\r\n    Personally contact any of the Kivy Collective administrators\r\n    Make him/her the owner of the repository which needs to be transferred. If the repository is already part of Github organization then create a new team and make the collective admin person the sole member of this team. Then assign the ownership permission of the repository to the new team.\r\n    Now the collective administrator can go to the repository settings and press Transfer Ownership button\r\n\r\n[1]:https://github.com/kivy-collective/kivy-collective.github.io/issues/new?title=Please%20add%20me%20to%20the%20collective&body=Thank%20you\r\n[2]:http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\r\n[3]:http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html\r\n[4]:http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.modules.monitor.html\r\n[5]:http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips\r\n[7]:https://github.com/kivy-collective/kivy-collective.github.io/issues/new?title=ShowcaseRequest&body=Section[enter_new_section_here]%20Thank%20you\r\n[8]:https://github.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
